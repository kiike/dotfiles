========

* absup: Checks packages against ABS. It can check arbitrary packages or the installed packages. It is useful
	if you are using an alternative architecture or prefer to build your own packages.
* absbuild: Just like scripts like aurbuild or yaourt, searches ABS and builds the packages you tell it to.
* upgpkg: A helper for Arch Linux package upgrades. It relies on a local branch with the "outdated" packages and
	a master branch with the updated PKGBUILDs, and will assist you of merging the changes and pushing them
	to your project repositories. Currently used successfuly by my contributions to Arch Linux PPC.
* xclip-operations: will pass your xclip URI to mplayer, put in your newsbeuter urls, etc.
