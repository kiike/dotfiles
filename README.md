Welcome to ArchScripts, a repo of small scripts for interacting with Arch Linux.

CONTENTS
========

* absup: Checks installed packages against ABS. Useful if you are using an alternative architecture
or prefer to build your own packages.
* absbuild: Just like scripts like aurbuild or yaourt, searches ABS and builds the packages you tell it to.
